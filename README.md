# Automated-Agent

In my 5th semester, I designed and built an automated agent using Unity. In this project, 3 collaborative agents, use Ant Colony optimization to find the most efficient path from a start point to multiple goal points and back to the start point. They use A* path-finding algorithm to move between two points.

The agents, if they detect another agent, the slower one will wait for the other agent to pass.
